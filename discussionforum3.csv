Her husband is working as a mechanical engineer on an S-pass. They do not have children.,,She had been working at a global software company for almost two years when the retrenchment notice hit like ""a bolt from the blue"", she said. ""I was completely shocked, because I didn't think I was doing badly at work... They simply said that my position was being made redundant,"" she said.,,After the retrenchment, one of the first things she did was to get in touch with various contacts she had made over the years to let them know about her job search.,,There has been at least one job offer which is in the works.,,But being a foreigner has also made the job search more difficult she said, as one of the first few questions potential employers ask is whether she is a Singaporean or a permanent resident. ""I do feel discouraged because although I am not a local, I have worked hard. It does feel like I had to start over again, and that I am back to square one in terms of my career,"" she said.,,During these trying times, when retrenchments are becoming more common, the reality is that,might find it harder to secure jobs, said Ms Ganapathy Sundaram, who,. Still, she acknowledges that it makes sense that any country will give priority to its locals in terms of jobs and policies."
